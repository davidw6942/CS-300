# CS-300 Journal

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course we were tasked with creating a program for ABCU that would sort a large data file of courses for users. Then it would allow them to print course information and any prerequisites for the course. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To begin I analyzed the project requirements and identified what exactly the program needed to do. Throughout the course we tried different approches using a vector, hash table, and BTS. With each we determined which would be most efficient in completing the task when prompted by the user. Through multiple revisions, tests, and tweaks to the program I determined a hash table would be the best choice for the project. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I faced many roadblocks during the projects. I had issues with reading csv files and ensuring the code functioned properly. To overcome these roadblocks I commited to doing thorough research. I revisited Zybooks lessons, referenced open stax for ideas, and read multiple articles that went in depth about data structures and their functions. Eventually I broke each section or requirement down seperately. Then focused on curating the code for each requirement to be fully function with the rest of the project. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working through this project provided me a wealth of knowledge about data structures and the importance of planning a project thoroughly before actually beginning to write the code. From this I learned the why and how behind choosing the right data structure. I know feel more prepared to do more projects that need a data structure that will perform efficiently. This course and project also gave me great insight on testing programs that I hadn't really had before. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This course project taught me that writing clean and well structured code is important to any successful program. Even more so than just getting the program to work and function properly. In the grand scheme of the program its important to make comments that someone else can review if they have to alter or maintain the code in the future. I was able to learn more about how logic works within the program by breaking down the functions into smaller reusable functions. I feel that my thought process has changed from a simple coder saying I hope the code works to more of a developer with planning ahead, organizing the code in a better way, and apply code that can be maintained or changed in the future but still function.
